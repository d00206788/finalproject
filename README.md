This is a task list and weather API application created using django for the backend and css and html for the frontend.

Features: Login/Logout, Register, CRUD, Weather API (search for specific cities and fetch data) and profile page showing username and last login.

I stuck with a light coloured theme, utilizing different shades of purple and basing my styling off of this color palette.
